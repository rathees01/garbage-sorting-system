Design and Development of Garbage Sorting System

Project Overview
This project, completed in July 2023, focused on the design and development of a Garbage Sorting System as part of a Mechatronics project. Utilizing SolidWorks for design and simulation, the project aimed to create a high-performing, low-cost conveyor belt system for sorting garbage. The system was fabricated using Arduino Uno, metal-detecting sensors, ultrasonic sensors, and servo motors, with a wood-made sorting arm tested through Finite Element Analysis (FEA) using SolidWorks simulation.
